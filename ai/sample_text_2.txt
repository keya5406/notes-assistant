CH-1 Introduction

DATA COMMUNICATIONS

Data communications involve the exchange of data between two devices
using a transmission medium like a wire cable.

Text, numbers, images, audio, and video are represented in bit patterns
(sequences of bits).

Text uses codes like ASCII, while images use pixels based on resolution.

Audio and video are converted into a stream of bits for transmission.

There are five components in data communication system:

Message
Sender
Receiver
Transmission Medium
Protocol

NETWORKS
A network is a set of devices or nodes connected by communication links to
share information and resources.

A node can be a computer, printer, or any other device capable of sending
and/or receiving data generated by other nodes on the network.

A link can be a cable, air, optical fiber, or any medium which can transport a
signal carrying information.

Computer Network
A computer network is a system in which multiple computers are connected
to each other.

The physical connection between networked computing devices is
established using either cable media or wireless media.

The best-known computer network is the Internet.

Advantages of Computer Networks
File Sharing – Enables remote access and sharing of files between authorized
users.
Resource Sharing – Allows sharing of devices like printers, scanners, and
modems.
Better Connectivity & Communication – Supports emails, groupware, and
seamless communication.
Internet Access – Provides high-speed internet across all connected
computers.
Entertainment – Supports online gaming and LAN-based multiplayer
experiences.
Cost-Effective – Reduces hardware and software expenses through shared
resources.
Flexible Access – Users can log in from any networked computer to access
their files.
Instant & Multiple Access – Allows multiple users to access and process
information simultaneously.

Disadvantages of Computer Networks
Lack of Data Security & Privacy – With multiple users accessing and sharing
files, security risks increase, leading to potential illegal activities.
Virus & Malware Threats – If one computer gets infected, the virus can spread
across the network due to interconnected systems.
Limited Independence – Centralized servers control operations, restricting
client users' freedom.
Lack of Robustness – If the main server or linking device fails, the entire
network may crash.
Requires Skilled Management – Proper network handling requires advanced
technical expertise; basic users may struggle with administration and security
settings.

Applications of Computer Networks
Financial Services – Enables electronic fund transfers, ATMs, foreign
exchange, and credit history searches.
Business – Facilitates data and resource sharing within organizations for
efficient collaboration.
Email Services – Allows instant communication via email globally.
Mobile Applications – Supports wireless communication through cellular
networks.
Directory Services – Centralized file storage enhances search speed and
accessibility.
Teleconferencing – Enables voice and video conferencing without physical
presence.

Types of Computer Networks
Computer networks can be categories by their size as well as their purpose.

The size of a network can be expressed by the geographic area.

Some of the different networks based on size are:

LAN (Local Area Network)
It is privately-owned network that interconnects computers within a limited
area such as a residence, school, laboratory, university campus or office
building.
They are widely used to connect personal computers and workstations in
company offices.
LANs are simple to set up and maintain.
All machines in a LAN are connected through a single cable.
Different topologies such as Bus, Ring, Star, and Tree are used in LANs.
High transmission rates are possible in LANs due to the short distance
between computers.
Traditional LANs run at speeds of 10Mbps to 100 Mbps, have low delay
(microseconds or nanoseconds), and make very few errors.

Advantages:

Newer LAN transfers data at high speed up to the rate of 10 Gbps.

LAN technology is generally less expensive.

MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)
A metropolitan area network is a computer network that interconnects with
computer in a metropolitan area like city.
MAN connects two or more LANs.
MAN is a larger than LAN but smaller than the area covered by a WAN.
It is also used for interconnection of several local area network.
The best-known example of a MAN is the cable television network.

WAN (Wide Area Network)
A wide area network (WAN) is a computer network that exists over a large-
scale geographical area.
A WAN connects different networks, including local area networks (LAN) and
metropolitan area networks (MAN).
It may be located within a state or a country or it may be interconnected
around the world.
Communication in WAN occurs through leased telephone lines, satellite links,
or similar channels.
When a packet(data) is sent from source to destination, it goes from one
router to another via one or more intermediate routers, the packet is received
at each intermediate router in its entirety, stored there until the required output
line is free, and then forwarded.
This concept is called packet switching.

There are two types of WAN:
Switched WAN
Point to point

Types of Computer Networks - Summary

Internet
The internet is a type of world-wide computer network.

The internet is the collection of infinite numbers of connected computers that
are spread across the world.

The Internet is a global network interconnecting millions of computing devices
worldwide.

It is the largest network, often called a "network of networks," linking
academic, business, and government networks.

Using standardized protocols, it enables communication and information
exchange, including text, graphics, voice, video, and programs.

The Network Edge
Computers and other devices are connected at the edge (end) of the network.

These computers are known as hosts or end systems. Router is known as
edge router.

Peer to Peer Network
Computers are connected together so that users can share resources and
information.

There is no central server for authenticating users, each of them works as
both client and server.

e.g. Bit Torrent

Client – Server Network
Client: Request servers for a task.
Generally called desktop PCs or workstations.

Server: Receive requests from the clients. Process and respond to them.
e.g. Web Server, Email Server

The Network Core
Defines the connection of different network segments together and process to
transmit data packets across the network.

It is implemented through the use of switching techniques.

Circuit Switched Network
A dedicated channel has to be established before the call is made between
users.
The channel is reserved between the users till the connection is active.

For half duplex (one way) communication, one channel is allocated and for full
duplex (two way) communication, two channels are allocated.

It is mainly used for voice communication requiring real time services without
delay.

Communication via circuit switching involves three phases:
Circuit Establishment
Data Transfer
Circuit Disconnect

Packet Switched Network
It is not required to establish the connection initially.

The connection/channel is available to use by users. But when traffic or
number of users increases then it will lead to congestion in the network.

Packet switched networks are mainly used for data and voice applications
requiring non-real time scenarios.

TRANSMISSION MEDIA
A transmission media can be defined as any medium that can carry
information from a source to a destination.

On the basis of transmission of data, the transmission media can be classified
into two categories:
Guided (Physical) transmission media
Unguided (Wireless) transmission media

Guided Transmission Media
Guided media are those that provide a wired channel from one device to
another.

The three Guided media commonly used for data transmission are:
Twisted Pair Cable
Coaxial Cable
Fiber Optic Cable

Twisted Pair Cable
Consists of two insulated copper wires twisted together to reduce crosstalk and
electromagnetic interference.
Two types:
Unshielded Twisted Pair Cable (UTP) – Cheap, easy to install, low noise
resistance, shorter distances.
Shielded Twisted Pair Cable (STP) – Protective mesh, higher capacity,
expensive, exterior networks.

Coaxial Cable
Has a solid metal inner conductor, braided outer shield, and insulating material.
Types:
Baseband – Single high-speed signal.
Broadband – Multiple signals simultaneously.

Fiber Optic Cable
Made of glass or plastic, transmits signals as light.
Parts: Core, Cladding, Jacket.
Advantages: Faster data transmission, longer distances, small size, high
reliability, high bandwidth.

Unguided Media (Wireless)
Radio Wave – Omnidirectional, large coverage, penetrates walls, mobile
phones, FM radio.
Microwave – Directional antennas, point-to-point, terrestrial and satellite,
weather dependent.
Infrared – Short-range, secure, remote controls, can’t penetrate walls.

NETWORK TOPOLOGIES
Network topology is the arrangement of the various components (links, nodes, etc.) of a computer network.

Types of network topologies:
Bus
Ring
Star
Mesh
Tree
Hybrid

Bus Topology
All computers and devices are connected to a single cable.
Data is transmitted in one direction; all stations receive the message.
Advantages: Simple, cost-effective, uses less cable, easy to expand.
Disadvantages: Prone to collisions, single cable failure breaks the network, performance drops with more devices.

Ring Topology
Devices are connected in a closed loop. Data flows in one direction.
Uses a token to control transmission.
Advantages: Stable, reliable, inexpensive cabling, faulty devices removable without affecting network.
Disadvantages: A single breakdown can stop the network, more devices increase delay.

Star Topology
All nodes connect to a central hub.
Advantages: Easy troubleshooting, failure of one cable affects only that node, supports high speeds, easy expansion.
Disadvantages: Hub failure stops all communication, cable routing can be complex.

Mesh Topology
Every device connects to every other device.
Advantages: Very reliable, failure of one link does not affect others, quick data transfer, no disruption when adding devices.
Disadvantages: Expensive, requires more cabling, difficult to maintain.

Tree Topology
Hierarchy of nodes with a root node.
Advantages: Easy management, supports broadband, scalable, failure of one node doesn’t affect the whole network.
Disadvantages: Main cable failure stops entire network, reconfiguration is complex.

Hybrid Topology
Combination of two or more topologies.
Advantages: Reliable, scalable, flexible.
Disadvantages: Complex and costly.

PROTOCOLS AND STANDARDS

Protocols
A set of rules for communication. Defines format, order, timing, syntax, semantics.
Ensures correct data exchange between devices.

Standards
Ensure compatibility and interoperability.
Types:
De facto – Unofficial but widely used.
De jure – Officially recognized.

OSI MODEL (Open Systems Interconnection)
A seven-layer conceptual model for communication between open systems:

Physical – Bit transmission.

Data Link – Frame transmission between nodes.

Network – Delivery of packets between hosts.

Transport – End-to-end delivery between processes.

Session – Dialog control, synchronization.
